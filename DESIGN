Given some primitives that we may reimplement for various databases
(primarily imagining SQL, but we might try even for things like Mongo),
we can perform various types of operations that either display useful
things or dig for useful things in a database.

A given database library will be OO, will have a bunch of things
it implements with standard args, and will offer enough reflection and
the like to let us sensibly work with it generically.

We'll prefer SQL terminology for the project, even for non-SQL databases.
We also will try to parameterise our calls in ways where we can request
various levels of coverage for value-based analysis. When a database
supports it we'll do this with in-database calls.
